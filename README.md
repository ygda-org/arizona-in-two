If anyone sets up the file system to have scenes and scripts folders they will be murdered by yours truly
I’ll refactor your chaos till your code starts to droop and unruly.
Your naming conventions look confused and newly.
Your tabs and your spaces are fighting brutally.
Your variables vague and your logic unruly.
You commit broken builds like it’s your sacred duty.
Step back from the keyboard — let someone code beautifully.
